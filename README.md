## Description and Functionality
This project utilizes Python Django. Current functionality includes user creation and login, ability to view posts when logged out, and ability to create, edit, and delete posts when logged in.

## Technoligies Used
- Python Django
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

## Future Improvements
In the future, I hope to add the ability to comment on posts, view, edit, and delete user account information without going through admin. I would also like to create more customized forms for login and sign up, and adjust current post formatting as well as adding other formatting capabilities.
